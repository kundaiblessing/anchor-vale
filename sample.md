The "o" in "o'clock" stood for "of". The term "o'clock" is a contraction of the phrases "of the clock", which was used to indicate the time of day before the widespread use of digital clocks and watches. For examples, "two o'clock" meant "two of the clock", or tow hourds after noon or midnight, depending on the context. The use of "o'clock" as a time indicator dates back to the 15th century, and it is still commonly used today.
