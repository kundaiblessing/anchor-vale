The anchor error message "Failed to connect to github.com port 443 after [time] ms: Timed out" suggests that there was a network connectivity issue when you tried to unanchor push your changes to GitHub. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as a slow or unstable internet connection, issues with your network configuration or firewall settings, or problems with GitHub's servers.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

Check your internet connection: Ensure that your internet connection is stable and working properly. You can try opening other websites or applications to confirm that your internet connection is not causing the issue.

Check GitHub's status: Check the status of GitHub's servers to see if there are any reported outages or issues. You can check GitHub's status page at https://www.githubstatus.com/.

Try again later: If there are no reported issues with GitHub and your internet connection is working properly, you can try pushing your changes again later. Sometimes, network connectivity issues can be temporary and may resolve themselves over time.

Use SSH: If you continue to experience issues with pushing changes over HTTPS, you can try using SSH instead. GitHub provides instructions on how to set up SSH authentication for Git at https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, you can try reaching out to GitHub support for further assistance.
